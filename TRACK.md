# Invoice Management API

## Overview

This is a Dockerized PHP-based Invoice Management API project. It provides endpoints to manage users, tax profiles, and invoices. The project is structured using the MVC architecture and includes automated tests, Docker support, and API documentation via Postman.

## 1. Docker Environment

### Multistage Dockerfile:
- Use **PHP 8.3** (or the latest stable version) for the development stage.
- Production stage with **PHP 8.3 Alpine** for a lightweight image.

### Docker Compose:
- Configure a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate the following containers:
  - **PHP**.
  - **Database** (MySQL or PostgreSQL).
  - **Web Server** (Nginx).
- Ensure proper volumes are configured for persistent data (database).

## 2. Project Structure

### MVC Framework:
- Use a PHP MVC framework of your choice (**Laravel**, **Symfony**, or **Slim**).

### Database and Migrations:
- Use migrations to create and manage the following tables:
  - **users**: Manage user information.
  - **tax_profiles**: Manage tax profiles associated with users.
  - **invoices**: Manage invoices associated with tax profiles.
- Use an ORM (e.g., **Eloquent** in Laravel or **Doctrine** in Symfony).

### RESTful API:
- Create the following CRUD endpoints:
  - **Users**: Create, read, update, delete users.
  - **Tax Profiles**: Create, read, update, delete tax profiles.
  - **Invoices**: Create, read, update, delete invoices.
- Responses should be in **JSON** format with appropriate **HTTP status codes**.

### Pagination and Filters:
- Implement **pagination** for query results.
- Implement **filters** for various fields (e.g., filter by name, date, invoice status).
- Filters and pagination should be configurable via query strings.

### Tests:
- Write **unit** and **integration tests** for the APIs.
- Use **fixtures** to load test data into the database.
- Test proper handling of data, relationships, and errors.

## 3. Documentation

### README:
- Instructions for setting up the environment with Docker.
- Steps for running the project, running migrations, testing the APIs, and testing the code.
- Provide an overview of the project and its features.

## 4. Postman Collection

- Create a **Postman collection** to test the APIs.
- The collection will include the following request groups:
  - **Authentication** (if applicable, e.g., JWT or API keys).
  - **Users**: Create, read, update, and delete users.
  - **Tax Profiles**: Create, read, update, and delete tax profiles associated with users.
  - **Invoices**: Create, read, update, and delete invoices associated with tax profiles.
  - **Pagination and Filters**: Examples to test pagination and filters in responses.
- Each request in the collection should be well documented with clear descriptions of input parameters and response data.

## 5. Git and Meaningful Commits

- Use **Git** for version control throughout the project.
- Write **meaningful commits** to describe each change, for example:
  - "Added User model and migration for users table".
  - "Created API endpoint for managing tax profiles".
  - "Added unit tests for invoice creation".
- Commits should follow a clear convention (e.g., present tense verb).

## 6. Security

- Secure user password management with **bcrypt**.
- Secure the APIs with **JWT**, **API keys**, or other authentication methods.

## 7. Other Details

- **Logging**: Configure logging tools (e.g., **Monolog**) to track errors.
- **Data Tests**: Ensure that relationships are properly handled in the database (user -> tax profile -> invoice).

## Final Result

- A **Dockerized application** with a well-configured development environment.
- **RESTful APIs** for managing users, tax profiles, and invoices, with support for pagination and filters.
- **Automated tests** to ensure code quality.
- A **Postman collection** to interact with the APIs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<Your-github-username>/recruitment-backend-track
   cd recruitment-backend-track
   ```

2. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Run migrations (e.g., with Laravel it would be something like):
   ```
   docker-compose exec php php artisan migrate
   ```

4. Use the Postman collection to test the APIs.
